Unit vs Functional Testing

Unit
-- Isolated, easy to pinpoint failures (but do not reflect user behavior)

Functional
-- Based on the user flow

Basics methods
getByText -> non interactive elements
getByRole -> almost everything else

Unit testing functions
for reusable functions that will be used on different parts
